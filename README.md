# Thermal-Rocket-Engine
An open-source project where we try to create an open source blueprint for a 3D-printed thermal rocket engine of sort

See the Wikipedia article on them here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_rocket. Thermal rockets allow for electric or nuclear rockets, which significantly bring the cost of spaceflight down. That allows for creative rocket designs, such as those utilizing solar power or lazers to get into orbit. I created this project as a way to bring more attention to them and to alternate forms of rocket engines, as I do not have the resources or skills yet to bring them into reality and mass production.

Please let me know of any and all suggestions that you have for the project. I am interested to know any thoughts on whether or not it works, or if there exists any other form of rocket engine that you feel is underappreciated. I will probably approve your pull request, as I don't have a process for this project yet. And of course, please let any important people in aerospace know about this project!

# TODO:

Formalize this mess

Have a discussion on how a thermal rocket engine would even work. Would it use electricity, nuclear power, or another form of power? And what is needed for it to be efficient?

Figure out how to even use GitHub to have a bunch of people create one blueprint

Define a plan for testing and for mass production

Execute that plan
